Contains classes to convert between ojAlgo and Apache matrix implementations. In particular Apache's matrix instanes can have  their elements supplied directly to ojAlg's matrix decompositions internal storage with allocating intermediate memory. ojAlgo matrix decompositions are typcally better performant.
